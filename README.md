# django-projects

## A brave new world

I started this repository for a school project. I basically have to create a three tier application. 
I asked some friends who are actual developers which languages and frameworks I should use. I ignored them all and chose Django. 
Mainly because I prefer Python to JavaScript or any derivatives of it.

I like it so far and have learned a lot. So I might continue creating new apps for my first project 'Adultung', 
or I might even start with some new Django projects. Who knows.

### Projects

* [Adulting](https://github.com/sraosha47/django-projects/tree/main/adulting)
A project offering apps that help with all the tedious, boring stuff that comes with adulthood. You know...responsibilities.
The first and only app in it, is an app to create budgets.
